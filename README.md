Today there is a wide spread talk about improvement of the human interface to the computer. Because no longer people want to sit and read data. Since there is a painstaking effort to be taken, this involves strain to their eyes. Voice is a better interface when it comes to illiterate people rather than Graphic User Interface in English. In this system user can easily convert text to speech, which will help blind people to hear the text. In this system there is one major module namely User, User will be allowed to upload the pdf file in order to convert into an audio file. System converts the uploaded pdf file to audio file and saves its details into database and audio file in a folder.
All the converted pdf to audio files will be listed to the user and he/she can play and listen to the audio file. 
Because no longer people want to sit and read data. Since there is a painstaking effort to be taken, this involves strain to their eyes. Voice is a better interface when it comes to illiterate people rather than Graphic User Interface in English. In this system user can easily convert text to speech, which will help blind people to hear the text. In this system there is one major module namely User, User will be allowed to upload the pdf file in order to convert into an audio file. The system comprises of 1 major module with their sub-modules as follows:

1. User:    
•	Upload PDF file: User will be allowed to upload the pdf file in order to convert into an audio file.
•	Read PDF: System converts the uploaded pdf file to audio file and saves its details into database and audio file in a folder.
•	Listen PDF: All the converted pdf to audio files will be listed to the user and he/she can play and listen to the audio file.
	Problem with current scenario

•	Reading text becomes impossible for visually impaired people.
•	Many time people don’t like to sit and read books or pdf related to work.
Drawbacks of the existing system  
•	Maintenance of the system is very difficult.
•	There is a possibility for getting inaccurate results.
•	User friendliness is very less.
•	It consumes more time for processing the task.
PROPOSED SYSTEM

•	Considering the anomalies in the existing system computerization of the whole activity is being suggested after initial analysis.
•	The android application is developed using Android Studio with JAVA as a programming language.
•	Proposed system is accessed by one entity namely, and User.
•	Admin need to login with their valid login credentials first in order to access the android application.
•	After successful login, admin can access all the modules and perform/manage each task accurately.
•	Admin can perform task such as User will be allowed to upload the pdf file in order to convert into an audio file. 
•	System converts the uploaded pdf file to audio file and saves its details into database and audio file in a folder.
•	All the converted pdf to audio files will be listed to the user and he/she can play and listen to the audio file. 
 
This was our project of System Design about “Pdf to Audio Converter”. developed in Django in Python programming language. The Development of this system takes a lot of efforts from us. We think this system gave a lot of satisfaction to all of us. Though every task is never said to be perfect in this development field even more improvement may be possible in this application. We learned so many things and gained a lot of knowledge about development field. We hope this will prove fruitful to us. ►	Websites
